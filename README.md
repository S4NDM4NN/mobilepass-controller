# mobilepass-controller
Mobilepass controller allows a takeover of the safenet mobilepass passcode generator for windows

## Usage

To use the mp_controller.py you can run it with python mp_controller.py \<pin\>

This should return how much time is left that the passcode is valid, and the passcode its self.



## Additional info

In gui.pyw there is a gui interface available that can be used to control mobilepass. This is what I use as my main mobilepass gui.
